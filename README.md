<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project
Implementation of Q-learning for solving Micro-Blackjack. 

Micro-Blackjack:
Goal: Have the highest number of cards less or equal of 5.
- Actions: `Stopp`You stopp drawing new cards `Draw`You draw 2,3 or 4 new additional cards (event is non-deterministic)
- You lose if you have more than 5 cards
